# cllab-java
Charlynn Lab Server Java version

This is a multi-module Maven project, initially including one module: cllab. The project depends on the `catsb-uta-common-lib-beta` library and is laid out according to the structure of `catsb-starter-beta`.

## Installation

First, you need to install Java and Maven. 

Second, you need to install dependencies.
This project relies on `catsb-uta-common-lib-beta` and other libraries not in Maven Central. To get these, email me at charles@charlesandlynn.love for the source code and install with `mvn install`.

Then, clone this repository and run the submodule cllab's CllabApplication.class
